// limitation or drawback of front door access 


// memory backdoor access
	--> it is only applicable for simulation purpose 
	--> In back door access we will directly target the memory for loading and retriving the data 
	--> all the loading and retriving will be happened at 0 time units 
	for backdoor access we have some system task and function 
		
		1. $readmemh 
			--> it is used to load/writes the hexadecimal data into the memory 
				
					syntax:
						$readmemh("input.hex",<target the memory>);

		2. $writememh 
			--> it is used to retrive/read the hexa decimal data from the memory 
					syntax: 
						$writememh("output.hex",<target the memory>)

		3. $readmemb
			--> it is used to load/ write the binary data into the memory 
					syntax: 
						$readmemb("input.bin",<target the memory>)
				
		4. $writememb
			--> it is used to retrive/ read the binary data from the memory 
					syntax: 
						$writememb("output.bin",<target the memory>);


	
Q. Implement a task for consective writes and reads
